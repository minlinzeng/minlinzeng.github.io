My First Hackathon and It Went Awesome
======

Opening
------

Thanks to patriothacks and all the sponsors' cooperation, I had my first hackathon experience with some of my friends and classmates. Before then, I'd never heard of hackathon nor did I realize it could be this fun (plus FREE and YUMMY food)! We were a little bit late that day since we were having classes before the opening, luckily we did make it on time and there were still tickets left :). But woohoo, there were a lot of people (as you can tell from the image) for the opening where the hosts introduced all the sponsors and their challenges to us.
