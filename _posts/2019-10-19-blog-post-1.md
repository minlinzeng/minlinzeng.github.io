My First Hackathon and It Went Awesome

======

Opening
------

Thanks to patriothacks and all the sponsors' cooperation, I had my first hackathon experience with some of my friends and classmates. Before then, I'd never heard of hackathon nor did I realize it could be this fun (plus FREE and YUMMY food)! We were a little bit late that day since we were having classes before the opening, luckily we did make it on time and there were still tickets left :). But woohoo, there were a lot of people (as you can tell from the image) for the opening where the hosts introduced all the sponsors and their challenges to us.

Winning
------
This is our [devpost site](https://devpost.com/software/predictive-image-classification#updates) to the challenge we completed. It's quite naive looking from now, however, considering I'm taking the data mining class at that time and had no experince at all about image classification, I would said this event really shaped my recognizion about machine learning, especially in the realm of computer vision.
